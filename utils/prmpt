OK, we are done with this program.

Now, can you take everything you know about this code and create a UI that will help me define the  feature engineering parameters? I want to use streamlit for the UI. It should offer me a list of CSV files stored in a given AWS S3 folder, along with the available feature. I will be then able to select a subset of features from each file, how to join the tables into one dataset, define interactions between pairs of features, and also indicate which columns will be used to create lagged features (with adjustable number of lags). I will also be able to define a name for the final dataset. Once the the selections are done, I will be able to save the feature engineering parameters as a JSON file to S3, so it can be read by the feature engineering code we've just written. 

I want to record the feature engineering process using MLFlow. Please add code that will evaluate and record performance of datasets with different feature subsets as the selected features grow.
